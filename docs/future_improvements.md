# Future Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements and refactoring that could be integrated into the Forgeflow project to make it more flexible and robust.

## More Triggers

Adding a wider variety of built-in triggers to connect to different event sources, such as:

*   Webhooks
*   Message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)
*   Filesystem events
*   Cron jobs

## More Tools

Growing the collection of pre-built tools to give agents more out-of-the-box capabilities, such as:

*   Interacting with databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
*   Making HTTP requests
*   Interacting with other APIs (e.g., Twitter, Slack)

## LLM Memory

Implementing a memory component to allow agents to retain context and learn from past interactions, enabling more stateful and intelligent behavior. This could be implemented using a variety of storage backends, such as:

*   In-memory cache
*   Redis
*   A database

## Refactoring

*   **Error Handling:** The error handling could be improved to be more specific and provide more context.
*   **Configuration:** The configuration could be made more flexible to allow for easier customization of the agent and its components.
*   **Testing:** The test suite could be expanded to cover more scenarios and edge cases.
